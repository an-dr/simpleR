A mechanical robotic framework designed for research, education, and fun.

The core concept of the framework is the **unit**. A unit is a flat platform that can support mechanics and electronics. These units are connected by vertical bars and can be covered with lids and cases. Below is the complete list of base parts:

- Unit: Interchangeable square-shaped platform that can support mechanics and electronics.
- Bar: Vertical structural element that connects the units. You need 4 bars per project.
- Lid: Cover with a closed top.
- Case: Cover consisting of four walls without a top.

All parts are designed for easy modification, extension, 3D printing, and assembly.

The framework includes both empty units and unit **prototypes**. Unit prototypes are pre-assembled units that come with some mechanics and electronics already installed. This feature provides users with a starting point to build upon.
