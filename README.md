A mechanical robotic framework designed for research, education, and fun.

The core concept of the framework is the **platform**. A platform is a flat platform that can support mechanics and electronics. These platforms are connected by vertical bars and can be covered with shells. Below is the complete list of base parts:

- **Platform**: Interchangeable square-shaped plate that can support mechanics and electronics.
- **Bar**: Vertical structural element that connects the platforms (3 variants). You need 4 bars per project.
- **Shell**: Platform walls with open top. (3 variants)
- **Lid**: Cover for shells.

All parts are designed for easy modification, extension, 3D printing, and assembly.

The framework includes both empty platforms and **prototypes** build on empty platforms. Prototypes are pre-assembled platforms that come with some mechanics and electronics already installed. This feature provides users with a starting point to build upon.

## Features

### Small Range of Parts

The framework is based on a small range of parts that can be easily combined to create a wide range of projects.

See: [Base Framework Parts](#base-framework-parts)

### Scalable

Choose the project of the size you need, and extend it in the future.

### Flexible

Adjust the project to your needs. Add or remove platforms, choose the right volume for you components.

### Easily Printable

All parts are designed for easy 3D printing. No supports are needed.

### Rigid

The special shape of the bars makes the structure stable and rigid in all directions. The shells provide additional structural support.

### Modifiable

All parts are designed for easy modification. They are shipped in STEP format, which can be opened in any CAD software.

### Embeddable Nuts

The nuts are accessible and reliable alternative to metal inserts than provide a strong and reusable connection between the parts.

### Modular

All the parts are made in the way so you don't have to re-print large volumes of plastic when you want to make a small change. Reprint only necessary parts.
